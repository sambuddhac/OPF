# OPF
This GitHub repository consists of source code, build files, input data files, and sample outputs/results tested on IEEE test cases, for the Linearized Optimal Power Flow (OPF)
model, written in C++. The particular algorithm, that this code implemets is the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based Proximal Message Passing (PMP)
